          "text": "The Biden-Harris administration revoked a plea deal with the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks after bipartisan blowback against the agreement.\n\nThe administration announced the original deal, which would have taken the death penalty off the table for the terrorists, only two days before its revocation. The deal immediately met overwhelming bipartisan blowback.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin issued a memorandum Friday killing the deal, despite the three defendants \u2014 alleged mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as well as his accused co-conspirators, Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak Bin \u2018Attash and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al Hawsawi \u2014 having already agreed to plead guilty to all charges, including the murder of 2,976 people, mostly Americans.\n\n\u201cI have determined that, in light of the significance of the decision to enter into pre-trial agreements with the accused in the above-referenced case, responsibility for such a decision should rest with me as the superior convening authority under the Military Commissions Act of 2009,\u201d Austin wrote to Susan Escallier, convening authority for military commissions.\n\nAustin withdrew Escallier\u2019s authority in the case to enter into a pre-trial agreement, assuming that authority for himself and immediately withdrawing the three pre-trial agreements.\n\nThe three accused al-Qaeda terrorists have been held at the U.S. military prison in Guant\u00e1namo Bay since 2003.\n\nSen. JD Vance (R-OH), Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, tore into the Biden-Harris administration at a Wednesday rally for cutting the plea deal with three accused terrorists.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden and Kamala Harris have weaponized the Department of Justice to go after their political opponents, but [their administration is] cutting a sweetheart deal with 9/11 terrorists,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need a president who kills terrorists, not negotiates with them.\u201d\n\nBradley Jaye is a Capitol Hill Correspondent for Breitbart News.

          "text": "On Friday\u2019s broadcast of CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Source,\u201d House Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY) reacted to the revocation of a plea deal with three defendants accused of involvement in the September 11 terrorist attacks, including accused plotter Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, by stating that he believes that \u201cbecause of some of the reactions, etc.,\u201d Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has \u201cdecided to utilize his authority and step in and revoke it.\u201d\n\nHost Kaitlan Collins asked, \u201c[W]hat\u2019s your reaction to hearing that Secretary Austin has revoked this plea deal?\u201d\n\nMeeks answered, \u201cWell, for me, I just think that he apparently didn\u2019t know, by relieving the person that struck the deal, it did not \u2014 was not cleared by him, and I think that because of some of the reactions, etc., he\u2019s decided to utilize his authority and step in and revoke it. It\u2019s something that I was surprised by. The State Department with reference to the Foreign Affairs Committee, not with the Armed Services where they have jurisdiction over DOD, but it was shocking to me also.\u201d\n\nCollins then asked Meeks if he supports revoking the deal, Meeks answered that he is against the death penalty because it\u2019s \u201ctoo easy\u201d for people who have committed heinous acts and that\u2019s why people who commit atrocious crimes often commit suicide and that they should suffer through a life sentence.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",

          "text": "Former President Donald Trump has taken a three-point lead over Vice President Kamala Harris nationally, according to a recent Harvard-Harris poll.\n\nThe poll, conducted between July 26 and 28, surveyed 2,196 voters registered voters nationally.\n\nWhen asked who voters would pick if the presidential election were held today, 48 percent said they would vote for Trump and 45 percent said they would vote for Harris.\n\nSeven percent of voters expressed that they were still undecided on who they would vote for.\n\nThe poll results come after President Joe Biden revealed his withdrawal from the presidential election and his endorsement of Harris for the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee. The poll also took place after Trump was shot during his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13.\n\nThe poll found that 48 percent of voters had a \u201cvery favorable\u201d or \u201cfavorable\u201d view of Trump, while 47 percent of voters found Harris \u201cvery favorable\u201d or \u201cfavorable.\u201d\n\nForty-eight percent of voters expressed they had a \u201cvery unfavorable\u201d or \u201cunfavorable\u201d view of Trump, while 47 percent of voters also expressed that they had a \u201cvery unfavorable\u201d or \u201cunfavorable\u201d view of Harris.\n\nA recent McLaughlin & Associates survey also found that Trump was leading Harris nationally by two points. This was the same difference that Trump had been leading Biden by prior to their June 27 debate.",

          "text": "Democratic strategist James Carville said Tuesday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Beat\u201d that Vice President Kamala Harris was \u201cnot close\u201d to beating former President Donald Trump in November.\n\nGuest host Michael Steele said, \u201cI want to touch on a little bit of the noise he made earlier this week, which I personally appreciated and wanted to make sure people understood what I thought of what you said, when you caution folks. All the exuberance and all the excitement we are seeing right now in the campaign is good, it\u2019s healthy, it is important, particularly given the campaign for Joe Biden was. Your point is don\u2019t let that exuberance cloud you to the reality. You still have a race to run here. Republicans are going to gird themselves and they are going to come out it hard, and so, take that enthusiasm and make sure it is channeled through infrastructure on the ground. I will let you speak to some of what you said there.\u201d\n\nCarville said, \u201cThank you, Sir because you said exactly what I was trying to say, and you said it better than me. And people would be wise to listen to Dave Wasserman, who you just had on, who is a very wise man, who said if we need to win this thing, we have to win by two. Some people say maybe we even need to win by three, and we are not close to being there yet. We need to keep our heads down. We need to have a good convention in Chicago. We need to go out campaigning and we need to launch attacks. We\u2019ve got to go here. We\u2019ve got to hit them hard. I think that the early signs are encouraging. I\u2019m not going to be. I don\u2019t want to be a downer here, but we have to be realistic. And you and I are a little older. We know a lot about what politics is, and we know someone about what motivates different people in this country.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",

Austin III on Friday overruled the overseer of the war court at Guant\u00e1namo Bay and revoked a plea agreement reached earlier this week with the accused mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and two alleged accomplices.\nThe overseer, retired Brig.\nGen. Susan K. Escallier, signed a pretrial agreement on Wednesday with Mr. Mohammed, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi that exchanged guilty pleas for sentences of at most life in prison.\nIn taking away the authority, Mr. Austin assumed direct oversight of the case and canceled the agreement, effectively reinstating it as a death-penalty case.\nHe left Ms. Escallier in the role of oversight of Guant\u00e1namo\u2019s other cases.",

Despite international condemnation, he vowed to continue the war against Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank, where Israel is killing and imprisoning scores of Palestinians each week, without any clear idea of its endgame.\n\nThe assassinations of senior Hezbollah and Hamas figures abroad have now sharply raised the risks of a larger regional war as Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah prepare retaliation, analysts say.\n\nBut the deaths of Fuad Shukr, a senior Hezbollah commander, and Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, will not change the strategic quandary Israel faces over how to end the war, govern Gaza or care for the civilians there. They are more likely to intensify the conflict than diminish it, making progress on a Gaza cease-fire even more difficult.",
